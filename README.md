# The Trophic Coherence Toolbox

The Trophic Analysis Toolbox is an easy to use open Matlab and Python toolbox that implements methods from our papers on the analysis of 
flow structure in directed networks, as well as related methods and performs a wide variety of operations on directed graphs.

At this stage we are still in the process of migrating the toolbox to this repository which we will continue to expand and update
over time.
